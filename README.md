# 🛡️ Ethical Hacking Lab – Red Teaming Playground 🔍💻

Welcome to my **Ethical Hacking** repository! This is a personal project space where I explore the offensive side of cybersecurity – especially **Red Teaming tactics**, tools, and techniques. Although my main journey is focused on **SOC and Blue Teaming**, red teaming is my *hacking hobby* 👨‍💻❤️.

## 🚩 What to Expect:
- 🔐 Red Teaming & Penetration Testing Scenarios  
- 🧪 Labs on Exploitation, Privilege Escalation, and Recon  
- ⚔️ Simulated Attacks & Defense Bypass Techniques  
- 🛠️ Custom Tools & Scripts related to Offensive Security  

## 🎯 Goal:
To **understand the attacker mindset** and build better defenses – because to defend well, you must know how to attack ⚔️🛡️.
